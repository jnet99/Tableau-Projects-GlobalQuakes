Global Quakes Analysis (March 2024 - December 2024)
Project Overview
This project analyzes earthquake data collected from March 2024 to December 2024 worldwide. Using Tableau Desktop, I created an interactive dashboard to visualize patterns, trends, and key insights regarding earthquake occurrences, magnitudes, and affected regions during this period.

Key Objectives
Identify global trends in earthquake activity over time.
Analyze the distribution of earthquakes by magnitude, depth, and geographical location.
Highlight the most affected regions and compare their seismic activity.
Provide insights to better understand seismic patterns and inform preparedness strategies.
